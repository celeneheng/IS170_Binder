The regression model is a supervised algorithm that Predicts a dependent variable based on independent variable values. It tries to find the best-fitting line or curve that represents the relationship between the independent variables ( input features)  and the dependent variable ( target variable). The goal is to have the smallest difference in value between the predicted value and the actual value. To analyze the difference between the predicted and the actual value, it confusion Matrix is often used. it generates TP, TF, FP, and FN; the TPR and the FPR are calculated using these values. A TPR of 1.0  is ideal, and an FPR of 0.0 is ideal.
