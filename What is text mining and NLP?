NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. It can allow computers to understand and generate human language.

Text mining and NLP Applications can be used in web search, spam filters, sentiment analysis, chatbots (ChatGPT, Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, MS Cortona), speech-to-text conversion, text translation, text summarization, and text generation.
Text mining processes text into a format that is easy for machines to read. The primary text mining processes are tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
